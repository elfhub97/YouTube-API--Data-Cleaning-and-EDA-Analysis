Hi folks!!
It is a simple webscrapping project. Basically I have exrtacted channel deatils of some of my favorites. and chooosing one to moving forward with indepth playlist analysis.
feel free to walk through the project.. In case of suggessions ping me on deepika.kumar97@yahoo.com

## Youtube Api Channel Part

By choosing  15 random youtube channels of different generes and getting meeningfull insights by playing with thae data.
Used pandas Data manipulation methods and **plotly** for visualizations🖖🏻

## Youtube Api Playlist Part

Guess what!? for analyzing videos I choose Madhan Gowri channel. maybe because of Ups and downs and backlashes🤡
and for great no of videos too. May be I can understand the pattern for  staying in bussiness for long😈
Used various data manipulations spent hours on cleaning and splited dataset into shorts and regular videos. (had a challenging yet fun time!!)
played around with python **datetime** , **RegEx** and made bunch of plotly animations🔥

So here is what my comeups are:
> Based on yearwise analysis 2022 not a year for MG\
>Like counts and view counts are pretty much in same range, There is no sudden hike in likes and views.\
>It means standard viewers stayed 🌈\
>views and likes pretty much propotional so A well liked channel it is🌹\
>Very Consistant content creator👏🏾 (Viedeo count tells!!!)\

So reason for staying in bussiness for long **Consistancy in content creation with loyal Subscribers**
